# Server shutdown command with countdown notifications

Added a shutdown console command that accepts an optional delay and custom message. The server sends countdown notifications to all players at progressively shorter intervals before disconnecting. The noticement dialog was redesigned to center on screen, match the Connecting overlay's font and color, and word-wrap the admin's custom message within the dialog bounds.
